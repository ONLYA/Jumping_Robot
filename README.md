In the video above, you can find that there are several functions for the jumpers to achieve:
* Compact
* RF controlled
* "Tank" moving
* Jumping (with "enhanced spring", it can jump over a wall)
* Rotation-free web camera
* Robot arms
* Middle-Man network
* Automatic recognizing the 3D position

There are more functions that it has:
* Items dropping (unlikely to be considered this time!)
* Broadcasting some sound (Maybe included)
